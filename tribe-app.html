							<h1>Tribe (Working Title)</h1>
							<p style="text-align:center;"><em>Tribe connects people who want to get things done (customers) with those who can help‚Äîand those who can teach them how (entrepreneurs and mentors). It‚Äôs a trust-based network where one's reputation opens doors, and everyone has a path to build their value.</em></p>

							<div class="section">
								<h2>üõ†Ô∏è What We‚Äôre Building</h2>
								<p>Tribe is a trust-based social network where users can:</p>
								<ul>
									<li><span class="highlight">Earn money doing what they already know how to do</span></li>
									<li><span class="highlight">Collaborate with others</span> as a <a href="https://www.fractionaljobs.io/blog/what-is-fractional-work">fractional</a> member of money earning opportunities of various sizes.</li>
									<li><span class="highlight">Learn new skills from mentors</span> and build toward meaningful work</li>
									<li><span class="highlight">Find quality regular folks</span> who can do what you need done</li>
									<li><span class="highlight">Become trusted and recognized</span> in your areas of interest. People can seek your seal-of-approval to boost their reputation.</li>
								</ul>
							</div>

							<div class="section">
								<h2>üí° Why Now</h2>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Millions of Gen Z youth</strong> in the U.S. are not in education, employment, or training (<a href="https://fortune.com/2025/03/25/gen-z-neet-not-in-education-employment-training-higher-ed-worthless-degrees-college/">link</a>)</li>
									<li><strong>Freelancing and gig work are exploding</strong>, but marketplaces are crowded and impersonal</li>
									<li><strong>AI enables smarter reputation modeling</strong> and skill-matching at scale</li>
									<li><strong>People want to work for themselves</strong>‚Äîbut need networks, not just platforms</li>
								</ul>
							</div>

							<div class="section">
								<h2>‚úÖ Why Tribe Works</h2>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>Entrepreneurs</strong> post opportunities that others can join and make themselves available to customers</li>
									<li><strong>Mentors</strong> get paid on their own terms, up front, or after the mentee succeeds</li>
									<li><strong>Customers</strong> find trustworthy help filtered through real-world relationships</li>
									<li><strong>Everyone</strong> can define their own skills and attributes. <strong>Other users</strong> can vouch for them. <strong>You</strong> decide which of those vouches are meaningful for you. This ensures everyone can define who they want to work with</li>
									<li>A user's <strong>actions which are positive for the network</strong> increase a user's reputation. Other users can use this to inform which collaborations they make.</li>
									<li>If you have skills that are in demand, you have high flexibility in how others can reach out to you, even getting paid per request, if you decide.</li>
								</ul>
							</div>

							<div class="section">
								<h2>ü§î Why Will People Join and Use Tribe?</h2>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>For the money.</strong> Whether earning directly through a Money Earning Opportunity or investing in skills for future payouts, Tribe helps people make it work.</li>
									<li><strong>For businesses and stores:</strong> Tribe is a low-maintenance way to support entrepreneurial customers and earn community loyalty.</li>
									<li><strong>To claim a space and build a brand:</strong> This is a greenfield social network. Early adopters can stake their claim and grow influence and authority.</li>
									<li><strong>To improve recommendations:</strong> Instead of depending on bot-manipulated online reviews, customers can rely on trust signals from their personal network.</li>
									<li><strong>For connection and purpose:</strong> Tribe makes it easier to find people who align with your values and goals, whether you're looking to work, learn, or mentor.</li>
								</ul>
							</div>

							<div class="section">
								<h2>üí∞ Revenue Model</h2>
								<ul>
									<li><strong>4.5% platform fee</strong> on completed transactions</li>
									<li><strong>First transaction is free</strong> to onboard users</li>
									<li><strong>Premium services</strong>: advanced search, mentorship tools, profile boosts</li>
									<li><strong>Insights into our data</strong> where searches for skills are not matching with entreprenuers describes unmet demand exists. We can sell such insights to help users "get in the way of success".</li>
								</ul>
							</div>

							<div class="section">
								<h2>üöÄ Traction</h2>
								<ul>
									<li>MVP prototype is nearly complete</li>
									<li>Core app features are implemented: profiles, attributes, vouching (attribute cosigning), fees to contact high demand users</li>
									<li>Runs on Android for certain and iPhone iOS with a little effort</li>
									<li>Needs UI polish and onboarding flow refinement</li>
									<li>We are in the process of having 100 conversations about the idea to confirm its utility</li>
								</ul>
