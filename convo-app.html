			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>How do you find the people interested in your niche interest, so you can hang out and build with them? The people interested, how do they know you are worth their time and effort? How do we connect people safely?</p>
			<p>Our app directly addresses this by letting people propose conversations, and letting other people express interest, and join them. Using 'categories', we allow users to create communities, which enhance the relevancy of connections and discussions. Categories also form the basis of our reputation system, which uses recommendations from other users to establish a user's legitimacy.</p>
			<p>We are a platform to help users easily find willing conversation partners, to share knowledge, establish themselves as thought leaders, and forge new friendships.</p><p>Our business model capitalizes on premium in-app features and exclusive in-person events, tailored to the interests and demands of our users. This strategy is designed to inspire brand loyalty and serve as a catalyst for our user's success, helping them transition from seeking to engaging. Join us as we build a brand that celebrates the transformative power of a good conversationâ€”or two.</p>

			<h2>Target Market</h2>
			<p>Professionals, 23-65, in urban/suburban areas.<br/>
			Motivations: personal development, community-building, and intellectual growth.</p>

			<h2>How will we make money?</h2>
			<p>Charge for premium features such as an instant conversation: Let people in your immediate time and space know you're up for a chat. Imagine using this in an airport, or at lunchtime at a convention. We will build a brand around the concept and value of conversation, part of which will be premium in-person events that folks pay ~$20 to attend. Within four years, doing these events several times a month in different cities, this business will earn ~$120,000 in revenue. We will discover additional avenues for monetization as we gain user feedback.</p>
			<h2>Traction</h2>
			<p>We have an app in production, available in both the Apple and Android app stores. Search for "Savvato Convo App". Next steps: expand the user base.</p>
