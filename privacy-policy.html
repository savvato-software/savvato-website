								<h2>Convo App, by Savvato Software</h2>

								This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, disclose and safeguard your information when you use
								ConvoApp.<br><br>

								Please read it carefully. You should only use ConvoApp if you agree with its contents.<br><br>

								This is a living document, and it will change with time. We will let you know it has changed by updating the
								Last Updated field at the top of the privacy policy.<br><br>

								If you continue using the app, you are deemed to have agreed with this privacy policy.<br><br>

								ConvoApp is a mobile application whose trademarks and software are owned by Savvato Software, a Colorado
								Limited Liability Corporation ("the company").<br><br>

								ConvoApp is updated regularly. Its functionality will grow over time. You will receive these changes to the
								app from either the Google Play store, or the Apple App store, determined by whether you have an Android or
								iOS device.<br><br>

								Our service is not intended for, and not marketed to, anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly
								collect personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, you should stop using our
								service, and come back when you are over 13. We'll be awesomer by then anyway.<br><br>

								When you register for an account, or modify your profile settings, we may gather and store your full name,
								email address, phone number, social media addresses, and images ("your personal info"). We do this in order
								to 1) verify your identity via two-factor authentication, and 2) to facilitate communication between you and
								other users.<br><br>

								On your profile settings, you can indicate your various social media URLs. This is not a requirement to use
								the application, and ConvoApp does not in any way connect to, or attempt to log into, any social media
								platform. The URLs you provide are optional, to give other users context about you, and are solely for
								informational purposes only.<br><br>

								We do not give out your full name, email address, phone number, social media addresses or images to anyone
								outside the company. At present, we do not sell advertising, nor use any third party resources which would
								require access to your personal info.<br><br>

								We do not make use cookies. Note that they may be placed there by other software on your device, however we
								do not intentionally make use of them.<br><br>

								We record your location, to provide you search results which are physically close to you. We understand how
								bad it sucks to have applications tracking your every move, so we only store your location with your
								explicit permission. We do this under two occasions. First, when you create a new conversation, we may use
								your location to set the conversation's location. Second, when you search for a conversation, we may use your
								location to provide relevant results. We do not read your location at any other time.<br><br>

								We record your usage of the app. Anytime you press a button a request is sent to our servers, and it may
								very well be logged. Without this information, the app would not function.<br><br>

								You have the right to remove the content and information that you have contributed, if and when you desire.
								Generally, you can use the app to delete information you have given us. Some information is archived for
								historical purposes. To remove any and all information, including that which is not made available for
								removal through the app, let us know by sending an email to <i>convoapp-legal@savvato.com</i>.<br><br>

								Of course, if required by law to provide or store your information, we will comply with happy hearts. We're
								nice people, and we attract nice users, so we don't expect this to be an often required action on our parts.
